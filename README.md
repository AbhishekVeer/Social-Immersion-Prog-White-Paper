**SIP Initiative: Jagdish Sheth School of Management (JAGSoM) in Collaboration with 8One Foundation**

The Social Immersion Program (SIP) at JAGSoM integrates social responsibility and community engagement into the PGDM curriculum. In 2024, 14 Business Analytics students partnered with 8One Foundation to address educational challenges in local schools.

**Solution Process:**

Preparation: Students secured permissions, developed an English-focused curriculum with storytelling and vocabulary games, and divided teams for targeted support per grade level.

Execution: Conducted interactive sessions, adapted methods based on proficiency, and collaborated with school staff to overcome language and resource limitations.

**Impact & Outcomes:**

Student Engagement: Enhanced language skills, critical thinking, and confidence.

Stakeholder Feedback: Teachers noted improvement; students were highly engaged and eager for more.

PGDM Student Growth: The experience deepened understanding of educational challenges, honing skills in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

This project exemplifies meaningful social impact through education, fostering growth for both community and future management professionals.
