**SIP Initiative: Jagdish Sheth School of Management in collaboration with 8One Foundation**

The Social Immersion Programme (SIP) is a unique initiative integrated into the curriculum of the JAGSoM (Jagdish Sheth School of Management) PGDM program. The course is designed to instill a sense of social responsibility and community engagement among management students.

In 2024, a cohort of 14 PGDM students specializing in Business Analytics undertook their SIP in collaboration with 8 One Foundation, an NGO focused on community development and educational upliftment. 

**The specific problems identified during the SIP included:**

•	Language Barriers: Many students in government schools had limited proficiency in English, which is often the medium of instruction in higher education.

•	Resource Constraints: The schools lacked adequate educational materials and infrastructure, which affected the quality of education.

•	Administrative Hurdles: The process of obtaining permissions from government authorities to implement the program was time-consuming and challenging, revealing the complexities involved in working within the public education system.


**Solution Implementation Process**
 
Preparation and Planning

The SIP began with an extensive preparation phase, where the JAGSoM students, guided by 8 One Foundation, developed a detailed plan for the program.

Key activities included:

•	Permission Acquisition: The students worked tirelessly to secure permissions from ELCIA and BEO to conduct their activities in selected schools.

•	Curriculum Development: The team designed a curriculum focused on improving English language skills through interactive methods such as storytelling, vocabulary games, and reading comprehension exercises.

•	Team Division: The students were divided into smaller groups, each assigned to a specific grade level, to ensure focused and personalized attention to the students.

**Project Execution**

Once the preparations were complete, the students began their immersion in the selected schools. The program's execution was characterized by:

•	Interactive Sessions: The students conducted sessions that were both educational and engaging, using a variety of tools and methods to make learning enjoyable.

•	Adaptation: The team had to frequently adapt their methods to suit the students' proficiency levels and the resources available in the schools.

•	Collaboration: Close collaboration with school staff was essential in overcoming challenges such as language barriers and resource constraints.
